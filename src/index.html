	<h1>Andrew's Coding Challenge</h1>
	<p> This is a simple webpage for my coding challenge for the USAePay Coding Assignment. I originally began with node.js and angular1, but graduated up to angular2 when I found the interface easier to use and link up with the front end and back end with fewer errors. A few conceits have been made to demonstrate competency with the API.</p>
